title = "Print Movement Speed";
description = "Prints movement speed in chat.

Usage: (Type the commands in chat)
- [i]/ms[/i] or [i]/ms help[/i] - prints help
- [i]/ms toggle[/i] - toggle print movement speed in chat
- [i]/ms timer <intervall>[/i] - set intervall to print movement speed
- [i]/ms log[/i] or [i]/ms log <name>[/i] - toggle log movement speed to file with filename: [i]mslog_<date>_<time>[/i] or [i]/mslog_<name>[/i]. [i]/ms log[/i] is enough to toggle logging off

Notes:
- Movement speed precision depends on your FPS e.g. with 60 FPS the distance is calculated every 1/60 seconds.
- Default timer intervall is 3. Increase this to get an average value from a longer period.
- The log command protocolls movement speed every frame into a file. Using the same filename twice results in writing the file again (not overwriting). Additionally the overall logged time and distance will be written at the bottom.
The log file is under
[h1]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Warhammer Vermintide 2\binaries[/h1]
or
[h1]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Warhammer Vermintide 2\binaries_dx12[/h1]
depending on which DirectX version the mod was used.";
