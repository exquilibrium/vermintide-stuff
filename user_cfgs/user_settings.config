Mods created for the project may utilize:
[list]
    [*]Mod options
    [*]Shared function hooks
    [*]Chat commands
    [*]Keybinds
    [*]Mutator support (only available in Vermintide 1 at this time)
    [*]Network calls
    [*]Rewritten, lightweight mod functions
    [*]An on-event call system
[/list]

The Vermintide Mod Framework originally started in Warhammer End Times: Vermintide as an unofficial modding platform. In the time since, VMF has been rewritten and redesigned with contributions from many unique members of the community; culminating in this unified project made for the arrival of official mod support.

If you're interested in creating mods with VMF, please check out [url=https://vmf-docs.verminti.de/]the project's wiki[/url].

pl.tablex.deepcompare(t1, t2)

Or to require individual modules:
local tablex = require'pl.tablex'
tablex.deepcompare(t1, t2)

Please DO NOT use require 'pl', this pollutes the global table.

Some modules have been removed due to security concerns: sip and lapp, and those related to file access.
Note that using the pretty module to print tables can cause a stack overflow due to it not handling recursion in table members.

		description = "Fixes the crosshairs to actually be representative of your spread.

[h1]Note: Does not alter spread in any way. Only changes crosshairs.[/h1]

In vanilla crosshairs are a static size on your screen not accounting for your custom FOV. They also don't account for some other math related to 2d projection of a 3d space (i.e. your monitor).
As you can see from the images this mod makes it so the crosshairs show the same (and correct) amount of spread regardless of your set FOV. (Example images are 120 and 45)

Warning: Very likely incompatible with other crosshair mods. Willing to work on compatability however.

https://github.com/Skwuruhl/vermintide-2-crosshair-fix

More in depth explanation: What vanilla specifically does is assume that 15Â° of spread is equal to 228 pixels of spread on a 1080p monitor. This ignores that the pixels of spread will change depending on your field of view.

It also assumes that 5Â° of spread will be equal to 228/3 pixels of spread. This ignores that degrees and pixels aren't a linear relation since it's a 3d space being projected to a 2d image.

Mod makes crosshairs scale using the tangent function as 1080 * tan(spread/2)/tan(fov/2) to get a radius to place the crosshairs away from the center of the screen. Math is similar to my customizable sensitivity mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1498189723"

[h1]IMPORTANT![/h1]
There seems to be a bug in the game launcher at the moment, and the mod may be marked as unsanctioned even though it's actually sanctioned.  Enabling the '[b]Auto-Disable Unsanctioned Mods in Official Realm[/b]' setting in the launcher (in the 'Mods' dialog) may work around this problem.

Version: 1.0.5
Changelist:
1.0.5: Fix for breakage caused by version 3.0 of the game.
1.0.4: Add support for Weave mode.
1.0.3: Disable the mod during Weaves so it doesn't crash the game, and avoid spewing error messages when the game claims there are more than 4 players.
1.0.2: Update for patch 2.0 of the game (support 6th talent for level 35 heroes).
1.0.1: Possible fix for network problems, and small adjustment of vertical positioning of widgets

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
    [*]The game setting 'Small Network Packets' (on the Network tab in the Options menu) may cause issues if enabled while using this mod.  I recommend leaving that setting OFF if you are using this mod.
    [*]People have reported that the host sometimes does not show the extra info (talents and item properties/traits) for connected clients.  I haven't been able to reproduce this, so if someone finds a reproducible test case, let me know.

[*] You can rename a loadout by clicking on its current name at the top of the loadout details panel.

When using with Onslaught Spawn Tweaks changes will usually take priority over anything Onslaught sets. After disabling Spawn Tweaks or changing any Spawn Tweaks settings while Onslaught is active it is recommended to restart Onslaught. Since Onslaught only applies its changes when you activate it.

MAKE SURE THE MOD LOAD ORDER IS CORRECT: in the launcher, put the dependency mods you see on the right above this mod.

Added rudimentary support for saving SpawnTweaks mod settings into presets. To save your settings into a new true_solo preset:
/st_save_preset true_solo
/st_load_preset true_solo
To delete the preset:

-------------------

Onslaught is a difficulty mod that, as its name would suggest, increases spawn rates of all enemies significantly.

However, this increase is nothing like a 'send in the next wave' or 'vanguard' deed. It features extensive changes to the very compositions of what the AI director throws at you, making hordes capable of throwing a mixture of elites at you, as well as making ambient packs much more threatening.

Furthermore, Onslaught features a redesign of [i]every single event in the game[/i] to make each of them unique challenges, and the highlights of the map.

Original Onslaught: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1619024877

Changes:
- Modified most horde compositions to make Skaven a bigger threat and added some more variety to beastmen (mixed hordes with Chaos/Skaven)

- Added more ambients to each area (slight increase to Chaos/Beastmen, medium increase for Skaven)

- Removed the restriction for bosses to spawn in their specific area to create a bit more variety and buff skaven areas (boss pool in a skaven area before: 50% ogre, 50% storm fiend)

- Buffed default patrols and added new custom patrols for every fraction (also mixed ones)

- Added Onslaught events for A Quiet Drink (Beastmen Loader removes the whole drinking mechanic + effects)

- Increased max threat level (cata 1-3: 80->100, Legend 60->80)

- Skittergate: Enabled pacing on the WHOLE map except for events + completely reworked the whole end event

Various event changes:
	- Righteous Stand: added Minotaur to the boss pool in the first event, exchanged the guaranteed troll in the final event with a boss pool (spawn, mino, troll)
	- Hunger in the Dark: end event is more front loaded now, small buffs in general
	- Halescourge: added a beastmen wave to the end event to make it a bit more dynamic
	- Athel Yenlui: added a small pre end event
	- Screaming Bell: buffed the end event, enabled special pacing for the boss fight and enabled pacing for the escape
	- Fort BrachsenbrÃ¼cke: buffed the whole end event (loops + initial wave)
	- Into the Nest: added a middle event, increased Skarriks hp
	- Against the Grain: added the Minotaur to possible boss spawns in the middle event, removed the chance for a double stormfiend, enabled special pacing during the whole event. Added specials to the end event + buffs in general.
	- Festering Ground: buffed the end event (bigger loops, different loops + big end wave) 
	- War Camp: added a few more enemies to the door breakthrough (ram) and buffed the ram event
	- Old Haunts: added a boss pool to the middle event
	- The Pit: slightly buffed the middle event, made the end event more front loaded
	- Garden of Morr: buffed the end event (boss on chain 1 and 3, hookrats on chain 2)
	- Engines of War: changed the boss pool for the middle event (before: Storm Fiend/Rat Ogre, now: Rat Ogre/Chaos Spawn)
	- Blightreaper: slightly buffed the middle event (split some waves up into smaller ones and made them come from different directions), moved the wave from button 5 to the end of button 4 (will start when all enemies from button 4 are dead) so you actually have to fight the chaos spawns, redesign of the button 5 wave
	- Dark Omens: Buffed the first event slightly, added an onslaught event for the secret path
	- various small changes

This mod does nothing on its own. It only serves as a modders' resource for adding temporary vanilla and custom items to a player's inventory. Eventually, it will also handle making these items display only to mod-using players in the trusted realm. This change would prevent custom item mods from impacting the experiences of unmodded players, a likely condition of sanctioned custom item mods.

Non-cosmetic mod items that provide an advantage will likely never be sanctioned, and sanctioning this library won't allow their use in the trusted realm.

INSTALLATION: Make sure that More Items Library is underneath VMF in your launcher's mod order, but higher than any mods that depend on it.

NOTE: This library is currently in development. Please expect instability.

[url=https://github.com/Aussiemon/VT2-More-Items-Library]Project Source [Git][/url]

Usage:
	
		[b]- If the item is completely new, and does not yet have an ItemMasterList entry:[/b]
		
			1. Create a new table
			
			2. Fill that table with the relevant regular fields of an ItemMasterList entry
			
			3. Insert your new entry into an array
			
			4. Pass that array to mod.add_mod_items_to_masterlist()
			
			Your item now has an ItemMasterList and NetworkLookup entry. ANY COMPLETELY NEW ITEM WILL CURRENTLY CRASH LOBBY PLAYERS WHO DO NOT HAVE MATCHING ITEM LISTS.
			
		[b]- When an item has an ItemMasterList entry, it can be added to your inventory:[/b]
		
			1. Use table.clone to copy the ItemMasterList entry
			
			2. Add a mod_data table to your entry copy (entry.mod_data = {})
			
			3. To this mod_data table, add any of the fields listed below in the backend_template for your item's slot_type. To look at your existing items for reference material, call the Vermintide Mod Framework's 'dtf' function on the return result of PlayFabMirror.get_all_inventory_items().
					
			4. Insert your new entry into an array
			
			5. Pass that array to mod.add_mod_items_to_local_backend() with your mod's name
			
			For example:[code]
local entry = table.clone(ItemMasterList[\"ring_06\"])
entry.mod_data = {
	backend_id = \"something_unique\",
	ItemInstanceId = \"same as backend_id\",
	CustomData = {
		traits = \"[\\\"ring_potion_duration\\\"]\",
		power_level = \"300\",
		properties = \"{\\\"power_vs_skaven\\\":1,\\\"power_vs_unarmoured\\\":1}\"
	},
	traits = {
		\"ring_potion_duration\"
	},
	power_level = 300,
	properties = {
		power_vs_unarmoured = 1,
		power_vs_skaven = 1,
	},
}
mod:add_mod_items_to_local_backend({entry}, \"your mod name\")[/code]
			
			Your item is now 'owned' for the game session, and will appear in item menus.
	
		[b]- When trying to remove items created by MoreItemsLibrary:[/b]

			1. Create a numerical array of backend_ids for removal (e.g. local items = { \"one\", \"two\", \"three\" })
	
			2. Pass that array to mod.remove_mod_items_from_local_backend() with your mod's name"

IMPORTANT: Make sure to put this mod after the required items in your mod launcher.

Compatible with the Loadout Manager and Weapon Kill Counter mods, and also supports inventory favorites (hover an item and press F).
It will also keep track of equipped cosmetics from PropJoe's Give Hats, Skins & Portraits mod.

Chat commands are included to offer some control over saved items.

Command list:
 - /sw_save_last (saves last created unsaved weapon)
 - /sw_save_%item_name% (saves a specified unsaved item, useful if auto-save is off - start typing and auto-fill will help you)
 - /sw_delete_last (deletes last created item)
 - /sw_delete_%item_name% (deletes specified item - auto-fill will show options when you start typing)
 - /sw_undo (undoes the last deletion in case you messed up)

Data is saved in: /Users/YourNameHere/AppData/Roaming/Fatshark/Vermintide 2/user_settings.config
Open in a text editor and search/ctrl+f for \"saved_items\" to find the entries, should you want to.

Campaign is a modification that connects together all of the existing Vermintide 2 levels into one long and continuous string of levels [u]with persistent health, ammo, items and cooldowns[/u]. Forcing You to strategize in larger scope than just single level, barely ending one level will mean poor start of the next one.
Failure to complete a level will restart it with same parameters as you had on the prior run.
[u]Campaign can be played with only the host player running the mod, however to have ammo and cooldown values carry over between levels (and to be able to access inventory at the beginning of each map), clients are required to have the mod installed and enabled as well.[/u]

Protip#1: You can bring bombs and potions from the keep to make first level easier!
Protip#2: You can access the inventory via its default hotkey at the beginning of each mission.
Protip#3: Finishing level with grimoire will clear all of your wounds in the next level and finishing with tome will max out your health.

Order of levels is following:
[i]Act 1 > Act 2 > Act 3> Skittergate > Shadows over Bogenhafen > Back to Ubersreik > Winds of Magic > Fortunes of War[/i]
(Screenshots on this page are in same order)
Bear in mind that you can start from any level you want as you normally would.

Completion of the entire campaign in one sitting is a feat reserved only for the truest of heroes!

[b]The save system:[/b]
Mod automatically saves your progress upon each level start. Game can be saved/loaded manually via use of following chat commands:

[i]/campaignsave[/i]
[i]/campaignload[/i]

[u]Save files are only compatible with people who participated in given campaign run.[/u]
Save file is named \"campaign.sav\" and is located at [i]%appdata%\\Fatshark\\Vermintide 2[/i]

Also if you wish to have your progress counted towards full completion of the campaign make sure to load saved game rather than manually starting from your last played map.


[B]CREDITS:[/B][list]

[i](Please note that a customized version of this mod is already bundled within the Campaign mod and it is not required to have Seeded Mode installed or enabled during the campaign run)[/i]
